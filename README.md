# Attention_based_model
**Project Title**: *Attention-based End-to-End Speech-to-Text Deep Neural Network*

This is a project implemented as part of my Introduction to deeplearning course. 
The project explores the attention model and its efficiency in ensuring accurate decoding of a given encoding. For example a tradional listen spell model for language translation
may not be efficient in dealing with different word lengths in sentences generated by different languages.
The project is inspired by this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.01211.pdf
